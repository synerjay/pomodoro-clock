## Pomodoro Clock

A side project I made practicing React and Tailwind CSS with a simple UI.

- It is a standard Pomodoro Clock with Session and Break times having 25 mins and 5 mins allocated each respectively. 
- A bell rings at the end of each interval and automatically starts the next timer
- A circular svg surrounds the clock and buttons interface indicating time elapse
- Can be used for studying or work dashes
